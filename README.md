# CPE Final Project

## Abstract
The purpose of this lab is to create a functioning design for a system that acts like an 
evaporation cooling system, in order to gain a better understanding of how process of 
we are able to regulate temperature in various environments. 
The circuit design for this project consists of many components, including sensors such as the Water Level 
Sensor and DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor, as well as user interface elements like the LCD Display, 
Pushbuttons, and Rotary Potentiometer. Additionally, it features actuators such as the DC Motor and
Adafruit Gear-Reduced Stepper Motor, along with indicators like LEDs. All these components are coordinated 
by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller, which serves to interface with the sensors and actuators to 
execute specific tasks based on input from sensors and users. Moreover, the circuit includes a ULN2003A 
driver for controlling the stepper motor and resistors for regulating current flow to the LEDs.
